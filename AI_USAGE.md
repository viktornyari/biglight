# AI Usage Disclosure

## Tools Used

**Cursor AI**: Primary coding assistant used throughout development.

## How AI Was Used

**Project Setup** (30 min): Generated boilerplate configuration files for Preact, Tailwind, and Storybook.

**Component Development** (2.5 hours): Assisted with syntax, fixes, and debugging while I implemented Button, Input, Dropdown, Card, and LoginDrawer. I designed all component APIs, props, and styling decisions.

**Storybook Stories** (1 hour): Helped identify missing states and edge cases while I structured the stories.

## What Was Not AI-Generated

**Design decisions**: Token management approach (CSS variables), component APIs, architecture, styling strategy, and theme switching implementation were all my design choices.
